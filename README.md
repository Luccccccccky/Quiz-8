## 1.Imaging Technique Inspiration
Quint Buchholz works as a freelance painter in Munich, Germany.
The major technique Buchholz uses in his paintings is **pointillist painting**, which helps to create a dreamy atmosphere. 
This painting skill makes pictures fluffy, matte and indistinct.

## 2.Coding Technique Exploration
This code operates to draw points on the canvas based on the color of random pixels sampled from the image.

- preload(): Loads an image called 'bee.jpg' into the img variable primarily.
- setup(): Sets up the canvas with a size of 400x400 pixels. Resizes the loaded image to fit the canvas.
- noSmooth(): Preserve the pixelated effect. Draws the image on the canvas at position (0, 0).
- draw(): Generates a vertical line of moving points and repeats continuously in a loop.

This coding technique can mostly realize the goal of imitating pointillist painting.
And I think it can be applied in our major project to represent our artwork.
